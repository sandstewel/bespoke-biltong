This is a first of its kind to quantify the dryness/wetness of biltong so that you can make an informed decision as to what moisture level you prefer your biltong to be dried to.</p> <p>To enhance your experience with your piece of biltong and bring the “technology meets tradition” into play, the BB1 Brain Box comes with a mobile application that can be downloaded and installed on your mobile from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.</p> <p>The mobile App will provide visualization of the biltong drying process through a graphical interface on your mobile, and guides you through the operating sequences of the BB1 unit.
