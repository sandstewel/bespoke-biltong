# Powering up

Switching on the power for the first time, or when powering up or recovering from a power failure BB1 will behave differently depending on whether the mobile
app (RemoteXY) is connected. In both cases switch on the power by connecting the supplied cable or any other Micro USB type cable to BB1 and connecting to the USB outlet (5V).

2. **Powering up BB1 _without_ loading new biltong (without the mobile app)**
    1. The Lowest LED on BB1 will flash at a 1 second rate (WHITE).
    2. BB1 will continue to flash for 1 minute, during this time do nothing as the system must powerup and continue with the process after the power failure.
    3. After a minute of no action, BB1 will enter andperform the system checks  as described in system health checks and then display current dryness on the LEDS.
    4. Essentially, no action is required as this is how it will recover from a power failure.
