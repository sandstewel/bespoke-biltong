# System health check

BB1’s diagnostics of its interconnected systems. On power up BB1 does a diagnostic test on all of its internal Systems and indicates the status of these systems on the LED’s. This is to make sure that you as the user can check
that everything is working correctly.

1. **Humidity and Temperature sensor**
    1. Green and white alternating LEDS indicate the Humidity and Temperature module is present and operational.
    2. Red and white alternating LEDS indicate that the Humidity and Temperature module is not operational or missing.
    3. The humidity & temperature sensor is an optional add on for BB1 and can be purchased separately.
2. **Light emitting diodes (LED’s)**
    1. A running sequence of LEDs to check all colours that are required to be displayed on the LEDs. The sequence will display red, green, blue and white.
3. **Drying scale**
    1. The internal scale which is representative of the dryness of the biltong will be checked to see if it is present and operational. If correct the LEDs will flash twice green to indicate that the scale is operational.
    2. If the scale is not operating, the system will check a number of times and if no response is received, LED 1, 3 & 5 will be white and constantly on. This shows that the scale is not working and the system will freeze in this state as it can’t operate without the scale being operational. Please contact Bespoke Biltong for assistance.
4. **Voltage conditioning**
    1. The internal voltage bus of BB1 is regulated at 3.3V DC. This is monitored to make sure that the power supply is operational and regulating at the correct voltage. This feature will only be visible when using the “mobile app” as the voltage and status of the voltage will be displayed on the “mobile app” only.
5. **Memory status**
    1. BB1 will determine how much of the internal memory has been used and indicate on the “mobile app” the percentage used.
