# Product overview

The Bespoke Biltong Brain Box (BB1) is an intelligent microprocessor controlled biltong dryness indicator. It is a patented and innovative device to get continuous feedback of the dryness/wetness of your prime piece of biltong.

The BB1 unit is fitted with LEDs to indicate 5 levels of dryness, much like the levels of _doneness_ of steak. This is a first of its kind to quantify the dryness/wetness of biltong so that you can make an informed decision as to what moisture level you prefer your biltong to be dried to.

To enhance your experience with your piece of biltong and bring the “technology meets tradition” into play, the BB1 Brain Box comes with a mobile application that can be downloaded and installed on your mobile from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

The mobile App will provide visualization of the biltong drying process through a graphical interface on your mobile, and guides you through the operating sequences of the BB1 unit. If the application is used, the following information is displayed on your mobile phone:

- Dryness factor %
- Temperature in degrees C
- Humidity %
- Initial Weight (g)
- Current Weight (g)
- Cut-off weight (g)
- Historical weight as it dries
